## Phase 3: RLS Policies Fixed ✅

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. Coupons Table
**Problem:** Policies only checked if user is manager, not if they're in the SAME store.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `coupons_insert_manager` - Now verifies store_id match
- ✅ `coupons_update_manager` - Added USING + WITH CHECK with store_id
- ✅ `coupons_delete_manager` - Now verifies store_id match

**Migration:** `fix_coupons_rls_policies`

#### 2. Loyalty Programs Table
**Problem:** Same as coupons - missing store_id verification.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `loyalty_programs_insert_manager` - Now verifies store_id match
- ✅ `loyalty_programs_update_manager` - Added USING + WITH CHECK with store_id
- ✅ `loyalty_programs_delete_manager` - Now verifies store_id match

**Migration:** `fix_loyalty_programs_rls_policies`

#### 3. Barbers Table
**Problem:** DELETE policy didn't verify manager is in same store.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `barbers_delete_manager` - Now verifies manager is in same store as target barber

**Migration:** `fix_barbers_delete_rls_policy`

#### 4. Time Blocks Table
**Problem:** Policies allowed barbers/managers to manage time blocks without store verification.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `time_blocks_insert_barber` - Verifies barber owns block OR manager in same store
- ✅ `time_blocks_update_barber` - Same store verification added
- ✅ `time_blocks_delete_barber` - Same store verification added

**Migration:** `fix_time_blocks_rls_policies`

#### 5. Store Hours Table
**Problem:** UPDATE policy had USING but no WITH CHECK, allowing data to be moved across stores.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `store_hours_update_manager` - Added WITH CHECK clause to prevent cross-store updates

**Migration:** `add_missing_with_check_clauses`

## Phase 4: Login Fix Applied ✅

### Problem Identified
After database reset, login was failing with error:
```
{"code":"unexpected_failure","message":"Database error querying schema"}
```

### Root Cause
Users created manually were missing critical authentication data:
1. ❌ Proper `raw_user_meta_data` (role, store_id) - Required by auth triggers
2. ❌ Records in `auth.identities` table - Required for Supabase Auth to work

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Updated `raw_user_meta_data` for all test users with:
   - `name`: User display name
   - `role`: User role (manager, barber, attendant)
   - `store_id`: Associated store UUID

2. ✅ Created `auth.identities` records with:
   - `provider_id`: User UUID
   - `provider`: 'email'
   - `identity_data`: Email verification metadata

**All test users can now login successfully!**

## RLS Policy Pattern Applied

All fixed policies now follow this consistent pattern:

```sql
-- INSERT Example
WITH CHECK (
  store_id IN (
    SELECT store_id FROM barbers
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'manager'
    AND is_active = true
  )
)

-- UPDATE Example
USING (
  store_id IN (...)  -- Must be in same store to read
)
WITH CHECK (
  store_id IN (...)  -- After update, still must be in same store
)

-- DELETE Example
USING (
  store_id IN (...)  -- Must be in same store to delete
)
```

## Security Verification

✅ Ran Supabase security advisor - no critical RLS issues found.

⚠️ Minor warnings (non-blocking):
- Function search_path recommendations (security enhancement)
- Auth MFA and password protection recommendations (optional enhancements)

## Testing Checklist

Now you can test all operations with proper multi-tenant isolation:

### As Manager (manager@test.com)
- [ ] Create/update/delete services in own store
- [ ] Create/update/delete barbers in own store
- [ ] Create/update/delete coupons in own store
- [ ] Create/update loyalty programs in own store
- [ ] Update store hours
- [ ] Manage time blocks for barbers in own store
- [ ] Activate/deactivate users in own store

### As Barber (barber@test.com)
- [ ] View services
- [ ] Manage own time blocks
- [ ] Update own profile
- [ ] Create/complete appointments

### As Attendant (attendant@test.com)
- [ ] View services
- [ ] Create/update services
- [ ] Create appointments
- [ ] View customers

### Cross-Store Validation
- [ ] Manager cannot see/modify data from other stores
- [ ] Barber cannot manage time blocks for barbers in other stores
- [ ] All operations properly isolated by store_id

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing:** Use the test accounts to validate all operations work correctly
2. **Monitor Logs:** Check for any RLS violations during testing
3. **Performance:** Monitor query performance with new RLS policies
4. **Documentation:** Update team documentation with new security model

## Files Modified

- Created 5 new migrations via Supabase MCP
- No application code changes required (RLS only)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, migrations can be reverted in reverse order:
1. `add_missing_with_check_clauses`
2. `fix_time_blocks_rls_policies`
3. `fix_barbers_delete_rls_policy`
4. `fix_loyalty_programs_rls_policies`
5. `fix_coupons_rls_policies`

**MVP Core Status:** ✅ Complete - All RLS issues fixed, database properly seeded, login working, ready for testing.
